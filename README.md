# datawarehouse-change-and-automation
This is a continuation from the [data warehouse tech-stack project](https://github.com/Doro97/datawarehouse_techstack.git) This project involves migrating the data warehouse from MySQL to PostgreSQL and migrating the dashboard from redash to Apache Superset in an effort to build a modular and programmatically adaptable solution for the data warehouse tech stack.
